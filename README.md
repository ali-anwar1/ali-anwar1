## Welcome to my Profile

## 👋 About Me
I am a results-driven Software Engineer with 9+ years of experience delivering scalable, high-performance web applications, large distributed systems, microservices architectures, multitenant applications, and asynchronous software solutions in agile environments. I primarily work with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python based technologies, and have a strong foundation in PHP, which I began my career with. I am a language-agnostic engineer and open to working with additional languages such as Java, Golang, C#, and Rust. I’ve developed scalable solutions using frameworks such as FastAPI, Django REST Framework, Gin, NestJS, Express, and Koa, as well as Laravel and CodeIgniter (PHP).
As a security researcher and smart contract developer. I am exploring Vyper and Solidity Smart Contract and practicing them.

On the frontend, I primarily work with NextJs, ReactJs, and ElectronJs, with prior experience in Vue.js (2.x). I have hands-on experience with both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) databases and have built APIs following GraphQL, REST, and SOAP standards.


🧠 My Expertise
- Full-stack development with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Python (DRF, FastAPI), PHP (Laravel)
- Database design and optimization with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and RedisbitMQ
- Message brokers: Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ
- Web3: Vyper and Solidity Smart Contract development
- Building enterprise-grade applications and scalable architectures
- Business-to-business API integrations and workflow automation

🚀 Currently, I'm
- Advancing my skills in Generative AI and Prompt Engineering, experimenting with tools like Cursor
- Deep diving into Web3 technologies such as Solidity and Wallet security
