## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Iâ€™m an AI-aware Full-Stack Web Developer with 9+ years of professional experience, working across Python, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Golang, and PHP.

Iâ€™ve developed scalable solutions using frameworks such as FastAPI and Django REST Framework (Python), Spring Boot (Java), NestJS, Express, and Koa (Node.js), as well as Laravel and CodeIgniter (PHP).

On the frontend, I primarily work with Next.js, React, and Electron, with prior experience in Vue.js (2.x).

I have hands-on experience with both SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL) and NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis) databases and have built APIs following GraphQL, REST, and SOAP standards.
