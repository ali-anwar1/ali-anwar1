## Welcome to my Profile

## 👋 About Me
I am a results-driven software developer, security researcher and smart contract developer with 9+ years of experience delivering scalable, high-performance web applications, large distributed systems, microservices architectures, multitenant applications, and asynchronous software solutions in agile environments. I primarily work with JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python based technologies, and have a strong foundation in PHP, which I began my career with. I am a language-agnostic engineer and open to working with additional languages such as Java, Golang, C#, and Rust. I’ve developed scalable solutions using frameworks such as FastAPI, Django REST Framework, Gin, NestJS, Express, and Koa, as well as Laravel and CodeIgniter (PHP).

🚀 Currently, I'm
- Advancing my skills in Generative AI and Prompt Engineering, experimenting with tools and IDEs
- Deep diving into Web3 technologies such as Solidity, Vyper and Wallet security
